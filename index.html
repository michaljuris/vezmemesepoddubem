      Simple, and to the point. The doctype can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. You'll notice that the "5" is conspicuously missing from the declaration. Although the current iteration of web markup is known as "HTML5," it really is just an evolution of previous HTML standards—and future specifications will simply be a development of what we have today.

      Because browsers are usually required to support all existing content on the Web, there's no reliance on the doctype to tell them which features should be supported in a given document. In other words, the doctype alone is not going to make your pages HTML5-compliant. It's really up to the browser to do this. In fact, you can use one of those two older doctypes with new HTML5 elements on the page and the page will render the same as it would if you used the new doctype.
